# Breadit-News

Breadit-News is a is a Reddit-style social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website. Think Reddit, but with endless bread images and puns.

It was created as a front-end project while studying at [Northcoders](https://www.northcoders.com), to provide a user interface to my [back-end project](https://github.com/PaulBondUK/be-nc-news).

## Libraries

It was created with React and CSS, using [@reach/router](https://github.com/reach/router) for internal routing and [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) for API requests.

## Prerequisites

```
node --version
```

## Installation instructions

git clone https://github.com/PaulBondUK/breadit-news

cd breadit-news

React will start a development server and open a browser window to show the Breadit-News App.
