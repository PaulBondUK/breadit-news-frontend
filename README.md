# Breadit-News

Breadit-News is a is a Reddit-style social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website. Because we all need another one of those, right?

Thankfully, this one is a little different. Think Reddit, but with numerous bread-related images and puns.

## Background

It was created as a front-end project while studying at [Northcoders](https://www.northcoders.com), to provide a user interface to my [back-end project](https://github.com/PaulBondUK/be-nc-news).

My main focus was usability, particularly on mobile devices. I built a hamburger menu using CSS and a little JavaScript.

## Technologies

It was created with Node.js, ReactJS, HTML, and CSS, using [@reach/router](https://github.com/reach/router) for internal routing and [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) for API requests.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have at least Node.js v12.12.0 installed on your machine. Run the following command to check:

```
node -v
```

## Installation instructions

First, clone the repo to your machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/PaulBondUK/breadit-news-frontend.git
```

cd into the folder.

```
cd breadit-news-frontend
```

Finally, install the dependencies.

```
npm install
```

## Running the App

To run the app run the following command in terminal:

```
npm start
```

React will start a development server, and a browser window will open to show the Breadit App.
