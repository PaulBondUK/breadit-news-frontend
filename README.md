# Breadit (Front-end)

## Introduction

Breadit is a is a Reddit-style social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website. Because we all need another one of those, right?

Thankfully, this one is a little different. Think Reddit, but with numerous bread-related images and puns.

## Background

It was created as a front-end project while studying at [Northcoders](https://www.northcoders.com), to provide a user interface to my [back-end project](https://github.com/PaulBondUK/breadit-news-backend.git)

My main focus was usability, particularly on mobile devices; I made sure everything was readable on smaller screens, and included a self-made hamburger menu for navigation.

Please try logging in and logging out, as components are built to read the logged in status and change how they operate, and there's a nice little easter egg for anyone who comes across a 404 error!

## Technologies

It was created with Node.js, React, HTML, and CSS, using [@reach/router](https://github.com/reach/router) for internal routing and [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) for API requests.
